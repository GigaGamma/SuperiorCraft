# SuperiorCraft

## Overview

### What is SuperiorCraft?
SuperiorCraft is an open source api that adds a configurable anticheat, custom blocks and items and much much more.

### Using SuperiorCraft
If you are going to use SuperiorCraft on your server, I strongly recommend __building it yourself__ because the releases aren't all that recent.

### Credits
The majority of the CustomBlock textures in the 'Customz' pack was created by CodeCrafted and can be found in their [Block Designer](https://codecrafted.net/blockdesigner) and the the custom items were created by [@superauguste](https://github.com/SuperAuguste).
