# Superior Craft

### What is Superior Craft?
Superior Craft is a Minecraft server that includes a robust and very straight-forward API that anyone can use with the only dependency: bukkit. To learn more about the API please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ThePenguinGamerzGitHub/SuperiorCraft/wiki).

### Credits
The CustomBlock texture pack was created entirely by CodeCrafted and can be found in their [Block Designer](https://codecrafted.net/blockdesigner).
