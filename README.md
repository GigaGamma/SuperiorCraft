# SuperiorCraft

## Overview

### What is SuperiorCraft?
SuperiorCraft is an open source api that adds a configurable anticheat, custom blocks and items and much much more.

### Using SuperiorCraft
If you are going to use SuperiorCraft on your server, I strongly recommend __building it yourself__ because the releases aren't all that recent.

### Credits
The majority of the CustomBlock textures in the 'Customz' pack was created by CodeCrafted and can be found in their [Block Designer]
(https://codecrafted.net/blockdesigner) and the the custom items were created by [@superauguste](https://github.com/SuperAuguste).

### Closing Notes
> Brian Zhou, CEO: If you do decide to read the rest of you, I can promise you that it's not useless crud.

> Auguste Rame, CTO: It really is.

> Brandon Read, CIO: naw, ya dont have ta if u dont wanna.



As [@thepenguingamerzgithub] says,
Don't forget to be awesome.
